# Program Description
This program creates a blank 3x3 matrix that two players can play tictactoe on. The players alternate turns and are prompted for the position in the matrix that they would like to play. If it is player 1's turn, the position will be marked with an 'X'. If it is player 2's turn, the position will be marked with an 'O'. After 9 turns the program will end and the players must decide who the winner is
